1. Approach to problem solving

Milestone 1: Understand the problem clearly
Ask questions & clarify the problem statement clearly.
Take an example or two to confirm your understanding of the input/output & extend it to test cases

Milestone 2: Finalize approach & execution plan
Understand what type of problem you are solving.
Brainstorm multiple ways to solve the problem and pick one
Get to a point where you can explain your approach to a 10 year old
Take a stab at the high level logic & write it down.
Try to offload processing to functions & keeping your main code small.

Milestone 3: Code by expanding your pseudocode
Make sure you name the variables, functions clearly.
Avoid constants in your code unless necessary; go for generic functions, you can use examples for your thinking though.
Use libraries as much as possible

Milestone 4: Prove to the interviewer that your code works with unit tests
Make sure you check boundary conditions
Time & storage complexity
Suggest optimizations

2. try...catch only works for runtime errors.
